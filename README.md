# SINGLE FRAMEWORK IN JAVA WITH DATATABLE IN FRONTEND 

This API has several options of front-end possibilities that can be applied. In this case we are provided with several versions. we shall attempt to use several frontends on the same backend to experiment and exploit customer and public microservice consumptions. The following would be used in here;
1. Angular frontend
2. Thymeleaf Frontend
3. Data table for Thymeleaf frontend
4. Postman frontend tested
5. All databases must always have seven fields to maintain consistence.
6. Use same names for microservices architecture
